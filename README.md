# DarkNovaClient

This is client written in Angular for my Dark Nova OGame like game.  
I mean it's almost not working, still in development in very early stage.  
First big frontend and Angular project ever, so better don't look here, it's more messy than LoL Client code :D

But if you're (foolishly) brave and want to run it, here ya got steps: 
1. Download and run this sh*t (server): https://github.com/ScuroGuardiano/Dark-Nova on localhost:1337 in development mode
2. Clone this repo
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm start```

It works for me :)
